### STAT-145-02

*Use the following information to answer the next three exercises:* According to a Field Poll, 79% of California adults (actual results are 400 out of 506 surveyed) feel that “education and our schools” is one  of the top issues facing California. We wish to construct a 90%  confidence interval for the true proportion of California adults who  feel that education and the schools is one of the top issues facing  California.

125. A point estimate for the true population proportion is:
     1. 0.90
     2. 1.27
     3. ==0.79==
     4. 400

126. A 90% confidence interval for the population proportion is _______.
     1. ==(0.761, 0.820)==
     2. (0.125, 0.188)
     3. (0.755, 0.826)
     4. (0.130, 0.183)

127. The error bound is approximately _____.
     1. 1.581
     2. 0.791
     3. ==0.059==
     4. 0.030

*Use the following information to answer the next two exercises:* Five hundred and eleven (511) homes in a certain southern California  community are randomly surveyed to determine if they meet minimal  earthquake preparedness recommendations. One hundred seventy-three (173) of the homes surveyed met the minimum recommendations for earthquake  preparedness, and 338 did not.

128. Find the confidence interval at the 90% Confidence  Level for the true population proportion of southern California  community homes meeting at least the minimum recommendations for  earthquake preparedness.
     1. (0.2975, 0.3796)
     2. (0.6270, 0.6959)
     3. ==(0.3041, 0.3730)==
     4. (0.6204, 0.7025)

132. Public Policy Polling recently conducted a survey  asking adults across the U.S. about music preferences. When asked, 80 of the 571 participants admitted that they have illegally downloaded  music.
     1. Create a 99% confidence interval for the true proportion of American adults who have illegally downloaded music. Interpret this confidence interval.
         $$
         \pi\in(0.1027,0.1715)
         $$
         I am 99% confident that between 10.27% and 17.75% of American adults have illegally downloaded music.
     
     2. ~~This survey was conducted through automated telephone interviews on  May 6 and 7, 2013. The error bound of the survey compensates for  sampling error, or natural variability among samples. List some factors  that could affect the survey’s outcome that are not covered by the  margin of error.~~
     
     3. Without performing any calculations, describe how the confidence  interval would change if the confidence level changed from 99% to 90%. 
         The confidence interval would be smaller if it changed from 99% to 90%, because it contains a smaller portion of the possibilities, so it can be smaller.
133. You plan to conduct a survey on your college campus to learn about the  political awareness of students. You want to estimate the true  proportion of college students on your campus who voted in the 2012  presidential election with 95% confidence and a margin of error no  greater than five percent. How many students must you interview?

You must interview at least 80 individuals to get the correct confidence interval, with a small enough margin of error.
