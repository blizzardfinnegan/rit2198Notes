Intro To Statistics 1
Professor: Birgit Coffey
Semester: 2198 (2020 summer)
Time Slot: Online

Professor Coffey is a lovely professor. She is accomodating of a wide range of technical know-how, and gives brief tutorials on how to calculate any answer necessary in her notes. All of her notes are thorough, and while she gives more reading if you wish to learn more, her notes alone do an excellent job of showing how to properly do each portion of the assignment.
Being very math inclined, and having touched on statistics in a class in middle school, we had a fairly good idea what was going on, and did not have to spend more than 2 hours a week on homework. There were never too many questions, nor too few. She established very well what she expected the student to learn, and what needed to be shown in the homework, quizzes, and tests.
